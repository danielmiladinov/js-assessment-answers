# A test-driven JS assessment

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/rmurphey/js-assessment](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/rmurphey/js-assessment?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repo includes a set of tests that can be used to assess the skills of
a candidate for a JavaScript position, or to improve one's own skills.

## I want to work on the tests; what do I do?
To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](https://nodejs.org/download/) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

Note that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node - see #12.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test

The command line runner is a work in progress; contributions welcome :)

You can also develop with live-reload and grunt-watch if that's your thing:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt develop

## I need help!

There may be friendly folks willing to help you in \#js-assessment or
\#jshotline on freenode IRC.

## I want to contribute tests; what do I do?

Submit a pull request! The tests are currently loosely organized by topic, so
you should do your best to add tests to the appropriate file in `tests/app`, or
create a new file there if you don't see an appropriate one. If you do create
a new file, make sure to add it to `tests/runner.js`, and to add a stub for the
solution to the corresponding file in `app/`. Finally, it would be great if you
could update the [answers](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment-answers)
as well.

Any substantial contributions will be duly credited in the readme, as well as
of course in the git commit log.

### Data-driven tests

If your tests need data that can be fetched via XHR, stick a `.json` file in
the `data` directory; you can access it at `/data/<filename>.json`.

### Available dependencies

The repo includes jQuery, Backbone, and Underscore. Do take advantage of these
libraries when writing your solutions!

## I want to see the answers!

First, bear in mind that looking up the answers is going to teach you a whole
lot less than you'll learn by working on the tests, even if you occasionally get
stuck. I'd recommend only looking at the answers once you have the tests
passing, to see if there's another way you could have approached the
problem. When you're ready to look at the answers, you can find them
[here](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment-answers); I'll do my best to
keep them up to date.

## I hate \<some technology you've chosen\>

This repo uses [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for the tests themselves. It uses the BDD style for authoring tests.
If this doesn't suit you, please fork away, or, better, submit a pull request that lets
this be more flexible than it currently is.
